I"à<p>In a series of Marketing Analytics projects, I used Online Retail II dataset to create cohorts based on monthly data, calculated retention rates and visualized them via a heatmap. Then I created RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segments, calculated RFM Score for each customer and segmented into 3 custom segments â€˜Topâ€™, â€˜Middleâ€™ and â€˜Lowâ€™ based on the total RFM Score. Finally, I calculated the revenue-based CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) for each customer.</p>
