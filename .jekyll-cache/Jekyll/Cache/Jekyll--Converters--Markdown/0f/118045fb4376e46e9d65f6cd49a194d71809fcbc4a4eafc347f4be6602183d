I"»<p>In this project, I built a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The datasets provided by Figure Eight contain real messages sent during disaster events and their respective categories. The task was to train the supervised ML classifier to automate categorization of the new messages so that different disaster relief agencies would receive only relevant ones. The model was then deployed as a Python Flask app to Heroku.</p>
