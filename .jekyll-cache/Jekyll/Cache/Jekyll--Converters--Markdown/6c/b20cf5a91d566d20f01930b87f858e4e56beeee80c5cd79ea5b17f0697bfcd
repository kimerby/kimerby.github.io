I"#<p>In this project, I analyzed purchase behavior of customers that bought 5 different brands of chocolate bars in a physical FMCG store during 2 years. In total, they made 58,693 transactions, captured through the loyalty cards they used at checkout. Based on the results of customer segmentation, I explored the segments sizes and answered the following business questions: 1. How often do people from different segments visit the store? 2. What brand do customer segments prefer on average? 3. How much revenue each customer segment brings?</p>
